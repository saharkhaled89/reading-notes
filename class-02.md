# TEXT

**When creating a web page, you add tags (known as markup) to the contents of the page. These tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users the appropriate structure for the page.**

* Structural markup:the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs

* Semantic markup:which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on

## Headings

**<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>**
**<h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>** 
**<h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>** 
**<h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>** 
**<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>** 
**<h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6>**

**paragraph**

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening <p> tag and closing </p> tag.

**<p> A paragraph consists of one or more sentences   that form a self-contained unit of discourse. The   start of a paragraph is indicated by a new   line.</p>**


**<p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up   into units of text. For example, a book may have   chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under   each heading there will be one or more   paragraphs.</p**

**Bold** & *iTalic*

<b>

By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.

**The <b> element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the <b> element does not imply any additional meaning

<i>
By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.

The <i> element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.

**HTML elements are used to describe the structure of  X the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs)**

**They also provide semantic information (e.g. where  X emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation)**

### INTRODUCING CSS

**CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear. For example, you can specify that the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.**

*cSS aSSocIateS StyLe ruLeS wIth htML eLeMentS*

**CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.**

*cSS propertIeS affect how eLeMentS are dISpLayed*

**CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.**

**uSIng externaL CSS for example:<link>,href,type,rel**
**using internal CSS for example:<style>,

* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).

* Different types of selectors allow you to target your  X rules at different elements.

* Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,  X although they may appear within an HTML page.


# Basic JavaScript Instructions

**A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon.**

**You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.**

*A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.*
*A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs*

* A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.

* Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, you might specify that a value must be remembered before creating a calculation using that value. 

* Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script. 

* Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 

* JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

* Expressions evaluate into a single value. 

* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a valu


#### IDecisions and Loops

*Scripts often need to behave differently depending upon how the user interacts with the web page and/or the browser window itself. To determine which path to take, programmers often rely upon the following three concepts:*

**EVALUATIONS You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results**

**DECISIONS Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down**

**LOOPS There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly**

# Comparison and logical operators

**you can evaluate by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be the  result will be aboolean
true or false**

* (==) is equal to : this operator compares two values (number, strings,or booleans) to see if they 
are the same
 
 'hello' == 'goodbye' thats fales because not the same string but 'Hello' == 'Hello that true because 
 the same string
 
 * != is not equal to : this operator compares two values to see if they aree not the same
 
 * ===strict equal to : this operator compaares two values to check that both the data type and value are 
 the same '3' === 3 returns fales because they are not the sam data type or value
 
 * !== strict not equal to: this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value a
 are not sam
 
 * > greater than
 * < less than 
 
 # logical operators
 
 comparision operators usualy return single value of true or false that allow you to compare 
 the result of more  than one comparison operator && 
 
 
 USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS 
 
 Here you can see that an if ... e 1 se statement allows you to provide two sets of code:
 
 1. one set if the condition evaluates to true 
 
 2. another set if the condition is false in
