# Images

 **control the size of an image in CSS**

 *You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.*
 *Specifying image sizes helps pages to load more smoothly because the HTML and CSS code will often load before the images, and telling the browser how much space to leave for an image allows it to render the rest of the page without waiting for the image to download.*


**using the <img> element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images. There are two ways that this is commonly achieved:**

**1: The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image (such as the small class in our example).**

**2: New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page. These class names are used in addition to classes that indicate the size of the image**

**there are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:**

 * On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.

 * On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

 

# RepeatIng Images background-repeat background-attachment

**The background-repeat property can have four values:**

* repeat:The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the backgroundrepeat property isn't used).

* repeat-x The image is repeated horizontally only (as shown in the first example on the left).

* repeat-y The image is repeated vertically only.

* no-repeat The image is only shown once.
The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:

* fixed The background image stays in the same position on the page.

* scroll The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.


# BackgroUnd posItIon background-position

This property usually has a pair of values. The first represents the horizontal position and the second represents the vertical.
left top
left center
left bottom 
center top
center center
center bottom
right top
right center
right bottom


* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

* You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

* Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

* You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

* To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites

                     
# Practical Information 

**search engine oPtimization (seo)**

*SEO is a huge topic and several books have been written on the subject.*

# on-Page seo

**In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order to improve its findability.**

*1: Page title The page title appears at the top of the browser window or on the tab of a browser. It is specified in the <title> element which lives inside the <head> element*

*2: url / WeB address The name of the file is part of the URL. Where possible, use keywords in the file name.*


*3: headings If the keywords are in a heading <hn> element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and give it greater weight than other text*

*4: text Where possible, it helps to repeat the keywords in the main body of the text at least 2-3 times. Do not, however, over-use these terms, because the text must be easy for a human to read.*

*5: link text Use keywords in the text that create links between pages (rather than using generic expressions such as "click here").*

*6: image alt text Search engines rely on you providing accurate descriptions of images in the alt text. This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches.*

*7: Page descriPtions The description also lives inside the <head> element and is specified using a <meta> tag. It should be a sentence that describes the content of the page.*

# hoW to identify keyWords and Phrases


**Determining which keywords to use on your site can be one of the hardest tasks when you start to think about SEO. Here are six steps that will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.**

* Brainstorm

**List down the words that someone might type into Google to find your site. Be sure to include the various topics, products or services your site is about.**

* organize

**Group the keywords into separate lists for the different sections or categories of your website.**

* research

**There are several tools that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider, such as: adwords.google.co.uk/ select/KeywordToolExternal (When using this tool, select the "exact match" option rather than "broad match.") www.wordtracker.com www.keyworddiscovery.com**

* comPare

**It is very unlikely that your site will appear at the top of the search results for every keyword. This is especially true for topics where there is a lot of competition. The more sites out there that have already been optimized for a given keyword, the harder it will be for you to rise up the search results when people search on that term.**


* refine

**Now you need to pick which keywords you will focus on. These should always be the ones that are most relevant to each section of your site.**

* maP

**Now that you have a refined list of keywords, you know which have the most competition, and which ones are most relevant, it is time to start picking which keywords you will use for each page.**



*Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.*

*Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.*

*To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.*

*FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.*

*Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch*


# Video and Audio APIs

**HTML5 comes with elements for embedding rich media in documents — <video> and <audio> — which in turn come with their own APIs for controlling playback, seeking, etc. This article shows you how to do common tasks such as creating custom playback controls.**

**HTML5 video and audio**

*The <video> and <audio> elements allow us to embed video and audio into web pages. As we showed in Video and audio content, a typical implementation looks like this:*

<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>

# how Flash works

*Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.*

**Whether you are creating an animation or a media player in Flash, the files you put on your website are referred to as Flash movies.**
**If you want to create your own Flash movie, you need to purchase the Flash authoring environment from Adobe.**

**There are several reasons why fewer websites are using Flash these days, including:**

*In 2005-6, a set of JavaScript libraries were launched (including Prototype, script.aculo.us, and JQuery) which made it easier for people to create animated effects using JavaScript.*

*When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 and later the the iPad in 2010, they took the decision not to support Flash*
