# Transforms

**With CSS3 came new ways to position and alter elements. Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are made possible by the transform property.**

**The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.**

* Transform Syntax
The actual syntax for the transform property is quite simple, including the transform property followed by the value. The value specifies the transform type followed by a specific amount inside parentheses.

* 2D Transforms
Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane. Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 

# Transitions & Animations

*One evolution with CSS3 was the ability to write behaviors for transitions and animations. Front end developers have been asking for the ability to design these interactions within HTML and CSS, without the use of JavaScript or Flash, for years. Now their wish has come true.*

* Transitions
As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. 

*There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay*

# Animations

**Transitions do a great job of building out visual interactions from one state to another, and are perfect for these kinds of single state changes. However, when more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states. In return, this is where animations pick up where transitions leave off.**

# 8 SIMPLE CSS3 TRANSITIONS THAT WILL WOW YOUR USERS

1. Fade in
Having things fade in is a fairly common request from clients. It’s a great way to emphasize functionality or draw attention to a call to action.

2. Change color
Animating a change of color used to be unbelievably complex, with all kinds of math involved in calculating separate RGB values and then recombining them. 

3. Grow & Shrink
To grow an element, you used to have to use its width and height, or its padding. But now we can use CSS3’s transform to enlarge.

4. Rotate elements
CSS transforms have a number of different uses, and one of the best is transforming the rotation of an element. 

5. Square to circle
A really popular effect at the moment is transitioning a square element into a round one, and vice versa. With CSS, it’s a simple effect to achieve, we just transition the border-radius property.

6. 3D shadow
3D shadows were frowned upon for a year or so, because they weren’t seen as compatible with flat design, which is of course nonsense, they work fantastically well to give a user feedback on their interactions and work with flat, or fake 3D interfaces.

7. Swing
Not all elements use the transition property. We can also create highly complex animations using @keyframes, animation and animation-iteration.

8. Inset border
One of the hottest button styles right now is the ghost button; a button with no background and a heavy border.
