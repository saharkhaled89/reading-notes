# EASILY CREATE STUNNING ANIMATED CHARTS WITH CHART.JS

**Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.**

**A great way to get started with charts is with Chart.js, a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.**

Setting up
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Chart.js demo</title>
        <script src='Chart.min.js'></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>

 

# The <canvas> element

**At first sight a <canvas> looks like the <img> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the <canvas> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.**

# Fallback content

*The <canvas> element differs from an <img> tag in that, like for <video>, <audio>, or <picture> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, like versions of Internet Explorer earlier than version 9 or textual browsers. You should always provide fallback content to be displayed by those browsers.*

*Providing fallback content is very straightforward: just insert the alternate content inside the <canvas> element. Browsers that don't support <canvas> will ignore the container and render the fallback content inside it. Browsers that do support <canvas> will ignore the content inside the container, and just render the canvas normally.*

# Required </canvas> tag

**As a consequence of the way fallback is provided, unlike the <img> element, the <canvas> element requires the closing tag (</canvas>). If this tag is not present, the rest of the document would be considered the fallback content and wouldn't be displayed.**

# The rendering context

*The <canvas> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering; for example, WebGL uses a 3D context based on OpenGL ES.*

# Drawing shapes with canvas

**Drawing paths**

**Now let's look at paths. A path is a list of points, connected by segments of lines that can be of different shapes, curved or not, of different width and of different color. A path, or even a subpath, can be closed. To make shapes using paths, we take some extra steps:**

*First, you create the path.*
Then you use drawing commands to draw into the path.
Once the path has been created, you can stroke or fill the path to render it.
Here are the functions used to perform these steps:

* beginPath()
Creates a new path. Once created, future drawing commands are directed into the path and used to build the path up.

* Path methods
Methods to set different paths for objects.

* closePath()
Adds a straight line to the path, going to the start of the current sub-path.

* stroke()
Draws the shape by stroking its outline.

* fill()
Draws a solid shape by filling the path's content area.

* The first step to create a path is to call the beginPath(). Internally, paths are stored as a list of sub-paths (lines, arcs, etc) which together form a shape. Every time this method is called, the list is reset and we can start drawing new shapes.

# Applying styles and colors

## Colors

**Up until now we have only seen methods of the drawing context. If we want to apply colors to a shape, there are two important properties we can use: fillStyle and strokeStyle.**

fillStyle = color
Sets the style used when filling shapes.
strokeStyle = color
Sets the style for shapes' outlines.
color is a string representing a CSS <color>, a gradient object, or a pattern object. We'll look at gradient and pattern objects later. By default, the stroke and fill color are set to black (CSS color value #000000).


## Transparency

**In addition to drawing opaque shapes to the canvas, we can also draw semi-transparent (or translucent) shapes. This is done by either setting the globalAlpha property or by assigning a semi-transparent color to the stroke and/or fill style.**

globalAlpha = transparencyValue
Applies the specified transparency value to all future shapes drawn on the canvas. The value must be between 0.0 (fully transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque). This value is 1.0 (fully opaque) by default.
The globalAlpha property can be useful if you want to draw a lot of shapes on the canvas with similar transparency, but otherwise it's generally more useful to set the transparency on individual shapes when setting their colors.

**Because the strokeStyle and fillStyle properties accept CSS rgba color values, we can use the following notation to assign a transparent color to them.**

# Drawing text

**the canvas rendering context provides two methods to render text:**

fillText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Fills a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw.
strokeText(text, x, y [, maxWidth])
Strokes a given text at the given (x,y) position. Optionally with a maximum width to draw

 
# Styling text

**In the examples above we are already making use of the font property to make the text a bit larger than the default size. There are some more properties which let you adjust the way the text gets displayed on the canvas:**

font = value
The current text style being used when drawing text. This string uses the same syntax as the CSS font property. The default font is 10px sans-serif.
textAlign = value
Text alignment setting. Possible values: start, end, left, right or center. The default value is start.
textBaseline = value
Baseline alignment setting. Possible values: top, hanging, middle, alphabetic, ideographic, bottom. The default value is alphabetic.
direction = value
Directionality. Possible values: ltr, rtl, inherit. The default value is inherit.
These properties might be familiar to you, if you have worked with CSS before.
