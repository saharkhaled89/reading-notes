# Lists

**There are lots of occasions when we need to use lists. HTML provides us with three different types:**

* Ordered lists are lists where each item in the list is numbered. For example, the list might be a set of steps for a recipe that must be performed in order, or a legal contract where each point needs to be identified by a section number. 

* Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point (rather than characters that indicate order).

* Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

# Boxes

**At the beginning of this section on CSS, you saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.**

*You can set several properties that affect the appearance of these boxes.*

# BorDer, mArgin & PADDing

**Border Every box has a border (even if it is not visible or is specified to be 0 pixels wide). The border separates the edge of one box from another.**

**Margin Margins sit outside the edge of the border. You can set the width of a margin to create a gap between the borders of two adjacent boxes.**

**Padding Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. Adding padding can increase the readability of its contents**

*CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box and You can also control the borders, margin and padding  X for each box with CSS.*

**It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties**

*Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.*

**Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.**

*CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image  X borders and rounded borders.*

# SWITCH STATEMENTS 

**A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value**

**You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple i f statements).**

# IF ... ELSE 

 *There is no need to provide an el se option. (You can just use an if statement.) With a series of if statements, they are all checked even if a match has been found (so it performs more slowly than switch).*

 # Loops

**loops check acondition if returns true acode block will run the condition checked again and if it still return true the code run again**

* FOR

* WHILE

* DO WHILE


* Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next.

* Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands.

* Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.

* if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

* switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy.

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements
