# LINKS

**Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing**
**Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing   </a> tag.**

# LAYOUT
*layout how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.*

**Building Blocks**

 *CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*
*Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text. You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors*
we have normal flow , relative positioning , apsolute positioning , fixed position, 

# fixed width Layouts
**Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels example Liquid Layouts designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.**

* The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

**Browsers require very detailed instructions about what we want them to do. Therefore, complex scripts can run to hundreds (even thousands) of lines. Programmers use functions, methods, and objects to organize their code.**

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
*unctions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements), Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task, and take parameters (informatiorJ required to do their job) and may return a value.
