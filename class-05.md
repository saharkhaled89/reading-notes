# Image

**Images can be used to set the tone for a site in less time than it takes to read a description. If you do not have photographs to use on your website, there are companies who sell stock images; these are images you pay to use (there is a list of stock photography websites below). Remember that all images are subject to copyright, and you can get in trouble for simply taking photographs from another website**

# three rules for CreatIng Images

*The <img> element is used to add images to a web page.*

*You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.*

*You should save images at the size you will be using  X them on the web page and in the appropriate format.*

*Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or  X logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.*


# Color

The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:

* rgb values: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

* hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.

* Color names: Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.


## understanding Color

**Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.**

* Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want. 

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# TEXT

The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:

* Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)

* Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and letters)

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,weight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an  X element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link
